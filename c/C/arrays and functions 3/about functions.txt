Program
--------
A program is a software module
that implements a task.
It is a logical collection of sub-tasks,
that are implemented as functions.

Function
---------
A function is a block of instructions.
It implements a sub-task of a program.

Syntax
-------
A function is made up of 2 parts:
1) Signature
2) Body 

Signature of the function is
made up of 3 parts :
a) Return Type
b) Function Name
c) Parameters (Optional)

Body of a function contains 
the implementation of logic
to perform the sub task.

Execution
---------
The term function means an 
executable module.
The function executes only when
it is called.

As a function is called then
program control gets transferred
from the point of call to the
definition of the function.

Next the code of the called
function executes.

Finally on completion of the
called function, the program 
control returns to the statement
following the call.

Parameters
-----------
Local variables of a function 
can by default be used in the 
function itself and not in other
functions of the program.

If variables of a function are
to used in other functions then
they must be passed as "parameters".

Parameters are values that are
passed, along with the function
call, from the caller function
to the called function.

Parameters are classified as:
1) Actual Parameters
2) Formal Parameters

Actual parameters are values
that are passed by the caller
function.

Formal parameters are values
that are received by the called
function.

Actual and Formal Parameter
for a function must match in
* count
* datatype
* sequence

Pass By Value
-------------
Pass By Value is a notification
to the system to create formal 
parameter as a copy of the 
actual parameter.

Hence on reading formal parameter
reflects the same value of the 
actual parameter.

But if modified then only the
formal parameter changes, and 
the changes doesnt affect the 
actual parameter.


Pass By Reference
-----------------
Pass By Reference is a notification
to the system to create formal 
parameter as a reference to the
memory of the actual parameter.

Hence on reading/writing the
formal parameter uses the same 
memory as of the actual parameter.

return
-------
return statement is used in function 
1) To terminate the current function 
2) Transfer back the program control to the place of call.
3) Optionally carry one value alongwith.

Return Type
--------------
Return Type is the specification of
the datatype of the variable being
returned.
It is the first part in a functions signature.

If a function is not returning any
value then its return type must be
set as "void".
