Sequential Search
-----------------
Sequential search sequentially
compares a value against all the 
elements of an array/linked list.

It begins comparison from the
first element.
It compares for equality of the
target value and the element value.
It stops :
1) When a match is found.
2) When entire array/linked list gets compared.

If a match is found then it 
returns the position (index) of
the matching element.

If no match found then it returns
a flag value (-1).
