            Arrays
           -------
Definition
----------
An array is a collection of 
variables of same datatype.
It is used to represent a 
homogenous set of information.

Memory Allocation
-----------------
System allocates a continuous
block of memory for the array.
It is splitted into similar typed
units, termed as "elements".

Array Access
-------------
The array takes a name and
its elements are auto-assigned 
zero based ascending index.

For access (read/write operations)
one uses a combination of :
  arrayname[elementIndex]

Declaration
-----------
To declare an array the syntax is :
 datatype arrName[arrSize];
Example :
 int arr[5];

Array can be of any datatype.
Array's name can be any valid
identifier.
Rules regarding array size:
1) It must be a whole number. 
2) It must be a constant value.
3) It must be a postive value.

Minimum size of array (usable) 
is one.
Maximum size of array is system
(Compiler + OS + h/w) dependent.

Usage Tips
-----------
1) Never access an array beyond
its boundaries.
2) Use loops to read/write/process
arrays.
