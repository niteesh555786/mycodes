void
-----
void is a special primary datatype
in C.
It is special because its variables or
arrays i.e. memory blocks cannot be
created.
It can only be used :
1) As a return type for functions.
2) As a generic pointer.

When void is used as a return type
for a function then it indicates that
the function will not return any value.

When void is used as a generic pointer
then it can be made to refer to 
variable of any datatype.
