Standard Streams
------------------
OS manages 3 standard streams and
makes them available to the active
application.

The streams are :

1) Standard Input Stream
The standard input stream is a 
unidirectional input stream that
connects the keyboard and the 
application.
A C program refers the standard 
input stream as stdin.

2) Standard Output Stream
The standard output stream is a 
unidirectional output stream that
connects the application and the 
monitor.
A C program refers the standard 
output stream as stdout.


3) Standard Error Stream
The standard error stream is a 
unidirectional output stream that
connects the application and the 
monitor. 
A C program refers the standard 
error stream as stderr.
