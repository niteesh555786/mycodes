Study of Operator : ++
----------------------
++ is a unary operator.
It is a unit increment operator.
It increments the value of operand by 1.

It can be applied in 2 forms:
1) Prefix form : ++Operand
2) Postfix form : Operand++

In both the cases it has the same affect
on the operand.
i.e. it increments the value of operand by 1.

But the two usages differ in priority.
Prefix use gets a higher priority.
Postfix use gets a lower priority.

Tip:
op++ expands as : op = op +1
Here op must be a variable.
If op is a constant then assignment will fail.

Examples :
int a = 10;
a++ 
expands as
a = a +1
a = 10 +1
a = 11

10++
expands as :
10 = 10 +1
10 = 11
assignment not supported
hence use of ++ on constants is not supported.

Tip : 
As C supports operator ++ for unit increment
so C supports operator -- for unit decrement.
