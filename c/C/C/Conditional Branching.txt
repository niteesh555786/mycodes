By default system executes every
program statement.
But there may be cases when it is
logically required to execute one set
of statements and skip another set 
of statements.
This can be achieved by implementing
conditional branching in program code.

C supports implementation of conditional
branching in three ways :
1) By use of "if" statement
2) By use of "switch" statement
3) By use of ternary operator. (see ternary.c)

Study of "if" statement
---------------------
"if" statement is used for conditional
branching of program code.
"if" has :
1) a condition
2) a block of code associated with it.

System evaluates the condition associated
with "if" and results in a boolean (true or false)
value.
When the result evaluates to true then
the block of code associated with "if"
executes otherwise not.

Study of else statement
-----------------------
"else" statement is optionally associated
with the "false" state of an "if" 
or an "else if" statement.

"else" has a block of code associated 
with it.
It executes only when the preceeding 
"if" or "else if" evaluates to "false" 
otherwise not.
