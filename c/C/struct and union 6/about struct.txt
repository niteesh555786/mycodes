struct
------
A struct is combination of heterogenous data.
It is used to define custom secondary 
datatype in C.

Example:
A combination of :
  Name
  Address
  Phone Number
  Image
  Blood Group
  College Name
forms an composite secondary datatype
termed as "ICard".

Use of Secondary Datatype
------------------------
Being a datatype, it can be used for
 Variable declaration
 Array declaration
 Pointer declaration
 Return type of functions. 

Memory Allocation For a Variable of
Secondary Type, Formed Using a struct
-----------------------------------
Variable of a secondary type formed
using a struct, is a composite block
of memory formed by the combination
of members used to define the secondary 
type.

Its size will be the sum of sizes of
its members.

It can store everything that its members
can store.

It can be applied :
1) Dot operator for member access.
2) = for copy
3) & for referencing
4) sizeof for size calculation

Rest operations on a variable of secondary
type need to be applied on its members.


Array of Secondary Type, formed using a struct
------------------------------------------
C allows declaration and use of arrays
of secondary datatypes formed using
struct.

These arrays are all similar to the
arrays of primary datatypes.

Only difference is in their datatype
due to which the array elements of
a struct type are composite units
of memory.

Passing Variable of Secondary Type, formed using a struct as Parameter to Function 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
When a variable of Secondary Type, 
formed using a struct as is passed 
as a parameter to a function then it
is passed by value.

Pointers of Secondary Types formed using struct
--------------------------------------------
C allows declaration and use of pointers
of secondary datatypes formed using
struct.

These pointers are all similar to the
pointers of primary datatypes.

Only difference is in their way of
dereferencing.

Nested struct
--------------
C allows declaration of a struct variable
as a member of another struct.
Do so is nesting of struct.
