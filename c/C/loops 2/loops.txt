Preface
--------
System executes one statement
once. But there are cases when
a statement or a set of statement
need to be executed multiple times.

Examples:
* Time update statement for a clock.
* Periodic change of traffic signal lights.

In such cases a programmer
designs loops.

Loops
------
Loops are mechanisms used to
repeat a set of statements
multiple times.
Loops are governed by a condition.
System repeats the statements
inside the loop as long as the
governing condition remains true.

Loops in C
-----------
C supports three types of loops :
1) while
2) for
3) do while

while and for loop can be used
interchangeably because they
check the condition first and
then allow program control to
execute the loop statements.
Resulting in ZERO-MANY
executions of loop statements.

do while loop allows the program 
control to execute the loop statements
first and checks the condition next.
Resulting in ONE-MANY
executions of loop statements.

Loop related terms
-----------------

Initialization
------------
Initialization is assigning a
start value to the loop controlling
variable.

Condition
----------
Condition is comparison of 
current value of loop controlling
variable with its stop value. 
It decides whether the loop
must cycle or stop.

Reinitialization
--------------
Reinitialization is change in 
value of loop controlling variable.
It must be of the nature by
which the value goes near to
the stop value.

Iteration
---------
Iteration is one execution of
the statements in loop body.
It is also known as a "cycle".


Steps to design a loop
--------------------
1) Identify the code to be repeated.
2) For the loop design think and finalize
   initialization, condition and reinitialization.
3) Code it.


Syntax
-------

while loop
----------
initialization
while(condition)
{
  statements to repeat
  reinitialization
}


for loop
----------- 
     1              2,5,8      4,7
for(initialization; condition; reinitialization)
{//on true of condition
  3,6
  statements to repeat
}
on false : 9


do while loop
-------------
initialization
do
{
  statements to repeat
  reinitialization
}while(condition);
