By default system executes every
program statement.

But it may be desired that based
on some criteria, a set of statements
must be executed and other set of
statements be skipped.

To implement such cases, C supports
conditional branching of program code
using :
* if statement
* switch statement

if statement
------------
if statement is used for conditional
branching of program code.

if statement has 
 * a condition
 * a block of code
associated with it.

Optionally if statement can be followed
by an else statement.

As system encounters an if statement,
then it solves the condition associated
with if.
On true system executes the block
of code associated with if, otherwise
skips it.
On false system executes the block 
of code associated with else (if defined),
otherwise does nothing.

else if statement
----------------
else if statement is used for conditional 
branching of program code.

else if statement has 
 * a condition
 * a block of code
associated with it.

else if statement represents a secondary 
condition associated with a preceeding 
if/else if statement.

It is evaluated by the system when
the preceeding condition results to
false otherwise not.

As system evaluates else if statement
then on true it executes the block
of associated code, otherwise it 
advances to next else if or else.
