Stream

A stream is a channel of data transfer
between connected devices.
It provides a neutral way of data transfer
across different mediums.

A stream may be
* Unidirectional
* Bidirectional

Unidirectional stream allows one way data transfer.
A unidirectional stream may be 
* Input Stream
* Output Stream 

Input stream transmits data from device to CPU/Program.
Output stream transmits data from CPU/Program to device.

Bidirectional stream allows two way data transfer.
A bidirectional stream is an i/o stream.
It supports to and fro data tranmission between the CPU/Program and the device.

For usage, a stream must be
1) Opened
2) Used (read/written)
3) Closed

There are 3 special streams that
are managed (opened/closed) by
the OS.
The OS makes them available to the active application.
Program only uses them.

The streams are :
 stdin : The standard input stream that connects Keyboard and CPU
 stdout : The standard output stream that connects CPU and Monitor
 stderr : The standard output stream that connects CPU and Monitor

See the daigram Streams.png

Through the header file stdio.h
C provides numerous functions that
allow management and usage of
streams.

Of the many functions in stdio.h,
two are :

printf
-------
printf is a predefined function that
takes data from the program and
puts it into stdout.
stdout is the stream responsible to
transmits the data to the monitor.

printf can transmit 3 types of information :
1) Information enclose in double quotes (static data)
2) Information stores in variables.
3) Cursor movement characters.

scanf
------
scanf is a predefined function.
It comes from the header file
stdio.h
It fetches data from stdin
(standard input stream that 
connectes Keyboard and CPU)
and transfers the same into
program variables.

scanf is an input blocking function
i.e. it will block the program
control until required data is 
made available in stdin.



Formatted Functions
------------------
C defines a series of functions
that can work on multiple different
datatypes.
To identify the current type
the function has to act on, it
requires a flag (indicator) called
as format character.

Examples:
%d : to indicate a decimal value in int type.
%f : to indicate a floating point value in float/double type. 
%c : to indicate an alpha numeric value in char type.
...
Such functions that make use
of format characters are 
under the category of formatted
functions.
The last character in their
name is 'f'.
