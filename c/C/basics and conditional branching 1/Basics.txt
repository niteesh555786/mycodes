What is a computer?
A computer is a device that can execute
programs.
--------------------------------------
What is a program?
A program is software module that contains
* Code
* Data

Code
-----
Code is a set of instructions of a program.
It is enclosed in a block, called as a function.

Function
--------
A function is a set, that contains instructions of a program.
It has a unique name for its identification.
It can execute, if called (invoked).

A C program must define a special function
named as "main", because O/S invokes it.
i.e. Program execution begins with main()
and in fact it also ends with the end of main().
Hence said main() function defines life cycle
of a C program.

Functions may be categorized as
1) Predefined : Pre developed functions that are enclosed in header files. Ideally they contain general purpose code.
2) Userdefined : User developed functions that are need of the program.

Data
-----
Data is information of a program.
It can be categorized as :
* Input
* Output

Input is the information that we give in to a program.
Output is the information that a program generates.

The input and output of a program must be stored in variables.

Variables
---------
A variable is a block of memory (RAM).
It has a unique name for its identification.
It allows storage and retrieval of data.
It can store one value at one time.
Its value can change.

--------------------------------------
Header File
 A header file is a collection of predefined functions.
 It can be included in a C program.
 Next the C program can utilize (invoke) any/all of the included functions.
 It has extension .h
 
--------------------------------------
Steps to define a C Program

1) include header files
2) define functions of choices
3) define a function named as main
4) User defined functions to contain
code and data as per the need of the
program.
