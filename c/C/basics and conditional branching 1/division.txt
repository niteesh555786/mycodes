Division Operators
-----------------
C provides 2 operators for performing 
division on whole numbers (int/long/...):
1) / (Divide Operator)
2) % (Modulus Operator)

Both the operators are binary operators
and both perform division.

/ (divide) operator returns quotient of division.
% (modulus) operator returns remainder of division.

----------------------------------------------

C provides 1 operator for performing 
division on floating point values (float/double)
 / (Divide Operator)

It is a binary operator and performs 
division until remainder becomes zero.
Hence no % operator for floating point
values.

/ to return the quotient.
