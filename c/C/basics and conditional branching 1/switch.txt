switch selection statement
-----------------------
A switch selection statement
is used for conditional branching
of program code.
In this sense it is similar to
if statement.

Details :
* switch selection statement
  can be used to check int/char
  types only.
* It compares one variable and 
  that to for equality only.
* It requires definition of
  case blocks. Each case block
  to represent one possible
  value of the switch variable
  and to host some corresponding
  code.
* Case value must be unqiue
  and constant. 
  i.e. Duplicate cases are 
  not allowed and a variable 
  cannot be used to represent
  a case value.
* A "default" case may be 
  defined to execute when
  the value of switch variable
  doesnt match with any other
  case. 
* Any case can be defined in
  any order.
* Every case must be delimited
  using a break statement.
  Otherwise system auto executes
  the next case.
