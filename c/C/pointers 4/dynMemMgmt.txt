Preface
--------
Program data is stored in memory (RAM).
Program can obtain memory in 2 ways :
1) Declaration
2) Allocation

Declaration method is the commonly
used method and it causes creation
of memory blocks that are managed
by the system.
i.e. The creation, use and destruction
of the memory block (variable) is under 
system's control.

Examples of memory obtained by declaration method:
 int i;
 float arr[4];

Under allocation method program code
takes control of life (creation, use and
destruction) of the memory blocks.

For implementing allocation method 
to obtain, to use and to free the 
memory blocks, a program uses functions 
like :
malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free().

malloc()
--------
malloc allocates a continuous memory
block of specific size in heap segment 
of RAM.

malloc doesnt set the data type of the
block and hence returns the starting 
address of the allocated block in void
pointer form.

Hence we typecast (convert) the address
returned by malloc into a datatype of 
choice and then use the memory block.

If malloc fails then it returns NULL.

Memory allocated by malloc by default 
has garbage in it.


free
-----
free() function is used to deallocate
the memory that was allocated using
malloc(), calloc() or realloc().

free() takes the starting address of
the memory block as a parameter and
deallocates it.


realloc()
--------
realloc() is used to expand/shrink the
memory allocated using malloc/calloc.

It takes 2 parameters
1) the address of memory block to be expanded/shrunk
2) new size in bytes

It makes the memory block of new size,
preserving the data.

It returns the starting address of the new block.


calloc()
--------
calloc allocates a continuous memory
block of specific size in heap segment 
of RAM.

calloc doesnt set the data type of the
block and hence returns the starting 
address of the allocated block in void
pointer form.

Hence we typecast (convert) the address
returned by calloc into a datatype of 
choice and then use the memory block.

If calloc fails then it returns NULL.

Memory allocated by calloc by default 
is clear (garbage free).
