void
-----
void is a special primary datatype in C.
It is used for 2 purposes :
1) As a return type of functions.
2) As a generic pointer.

It is special because its variables/arrays
cannot be declared.

When void is used as a return type of 
a function then it indicates that the 
function will not return any value.

When void is used as a pointer type
then the pointer becomes a "generic pointer".

Generic Pointer
-------------
A void pointer is a generic pointer.

A generic pointer can be used to 
refer to a variable/array/... of any
datatype.

Known that system uses datatype of
a pointer for dereferencing and in
pointer arithmetic.

Also known that for the system size
of void is zero or unknown.

Hence a void pointer cannot be directly
dereferenced or be used in pointer arithmetic.

In order to dereference a void pointer
or to use it in arithmetic, it must be
type casted (converted) into an appropriate
type.
