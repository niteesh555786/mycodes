printf 
-------
* printf is a predefined function that comes
from header file stdio.h
* printf takes program data and outputs it
into stdout.
* stdout is a stream that connects a C program
with the monitor.
* So the data outputted by printf reaches
the monitor.

printf can output 3 types of data.
------------------------------
1) Data enclosed in double quotes.
2) Data stored in variables.
3) Cursor movement characters.


To control cursor movement in the output
screen, C provides special escape sequence
characters that can be used along with
functions like printf.
