A computer is a device that can execute programs.

What is a program?
-------------------
A program is a software entity 
designed to accompalish a task.
It is made up of:
1) Code
2) Data

Code
-----
Code means instructions.
Code must be enclosed in functions.

Functions
----------
A function
1) Is a set of instructions.
2) Is identified by a unique name.
3) It performs a sub-task for the program.
4) It executes, on call (invokation).

Functions are of 2 types.
* Predefined
* Userdefined

Predefined functions 
 Are ready to use functions.
 They accompalish some general task.
 They are available through header files.

Userdefined functions 
 Are defined and then used.
 They accompalish some particular task.


Header File
-------------
A header file is a collection of
predefined functions.
It is can be included in a C program
after which the program may readily
use one to many of its functions.


Data
------
Data means the information.
Data can be classified as :
1) Input : Input is the information that a program gets.
2) Output : Output is the information that a program generates.

Data must be stored in variables.

Variable
---------
A variable 
1) Is a reserved block of memory (RAM).
2) Is identified by a unique name.
3) Allows storage and retrieval of data.
4) Can store a single value at a time.
5) Can change.
