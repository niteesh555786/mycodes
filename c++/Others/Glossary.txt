class 
-------
A class is a collection of functions 
and data members.
It defines a custom secondary datatype.
Making a class is implementing OOP concept
Encapsulation.

Member Variables
------------------
Member variables are the data members
that belong to a class.
It represents state of an object.

Member Functions
--------------------
Member functions are functions that
belong to a class.
They perform an operation for an object.

Object
---------
Object is an instance of a class.
Object can store and process data.
Its storage capacity is defined by the
member variables of the class.
Its processing capacity is defined by
the member functions of the class.

this
------
this is a system defined formal parameter
for member functions of the class.

It is a pointer of type current class.

this is initialized with the address of the
caller object of the function.

this is used to identify the object inside
the member function.

this is a constant pointer, cannot be modified
to refer to any other address.

constructor
-------------
A constructor is a special member function
of the class.
It has the same name as of the class and no
return type specification.
It is auto invoked as object of the class is
created.
It is used to initialize the object.

Constructor Overloading
-----------------------
Constructor Overloading is defining multiple
constructors for a class with different
set of parameters.

Destructor
-------------
A destructor is a special member function of the class.
It has the same name as of the  class preceeded by a ~  
and  has no return type specification.
It is always parameterless.
It cannot be overloaded.
It gets invoked automatically as life of the object gets over.
It is used to clear the resources used by the object.

new
-----
Operator new is used to dynamically allocate
memory for objects and arrays.
For array creation it takes the syntax :
  ptr = new datatype[arraySize];
For object creation it takes the syntax :
  ptr = new class(parameters);

Such an array or object : 
 1) gets allocated in heap segment of RAM.
 2) is accessible through its address only.
 3) has custom life that is controlled by code.

delete
--------
Operator delete is used to dynamically deallocate
memory for objects and arrays allocated using
operator new.
For deallocation it takes the syntax :
  delete ptr;
Where ptr is a pointer to array or object
allocated using new.
 
Operator Overloading 
--------------------
Operator Overloading is defining
operator functions that provide 
the logic of operator action on the
objects of secondary datatypes.

Function Overloading 
--------------------
Function overloading is defining multiple
functions with the same name and different 
set of parameters.
