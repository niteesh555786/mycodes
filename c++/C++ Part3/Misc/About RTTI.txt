RTTI
=========

C++ implements runtime polymorphism 
through the use of class hierarchies, 
virtual functions, and base-class pointers. 

RTTI (Run-time type identification)
is a mechanism used to determine,
at run time, the type of object being
referred by a base class reference
or pointer:

Its most commonly used form is :
typeid(object)

Here, object is the object whose type 
is to be obtained. It may be of any type,
including the built-in types and class type.

typeid returns an object of type type_info 
that describes the type of object.

The type_info class defines the following members:
 bool operator == (const type_info &ob);
 bool operator != (const type_info &ob);
 const char *name( );

The overloaded == and !=  for the 
comparison of types. 
The name( ) function returns the name 
of the type.
