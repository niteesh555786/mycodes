Object as parameter to function
-----------------------------
C++ allows passing and receiving objects
as parameters to functions.

1) PASS BY VALUE
---------------------
To pass an object as parameter, simply
use the object name.
To receive an object as parameter declare
the formal parameter as an object.

On call, the formal parameter object
becomes a copy of the actual parameter
object.
i.e. by default the objects as parameters
to functions, are passed by value.

2) PASS BY ADDRESS
-----------------------
It is possible to pass address of an object 
as parameter to a function.

To receive addres of an object as parameter 
declare the formal parameter as a pointer.

On call, the formal parameter pointer gets
initialized with the address of the object.
Next the pointer can be dereferenced to 
access members of the class. In such a case
the caller object for the members would
be the object, address of which is stored in
the pointer.

3) PASS BY REFERENCE
