friend functions
-----------------
A friend function is a non member function
that it is granted access of private and
protected members of the class or a struct, 
using a respective object.

public member being already accessible.

FYI:
Using friend violates OOP concept of 
abstraction, makes the application not a
pure object oriented one.
