Access Specifiers
------------------
 Access Specifiers control the usability
 of members (data and functions) of a 
 class or a struct.

 C++ provides 3 access specifiers.
 1) private (default for a class)
 2) protected 
 3) public (default for a struct)

 private 
---------
 private access specifier limits the usage
 of the member (data or function) within
 the class or struct only.
 A private member is not accessible to
 members of other classes or structs or
 to non members.

 protected
-----------
 protected access specifier limits the usage
 of the member (data or function) within
  1) the class or struct only
  2) the derived class or struct only

 A protected member is not accessible to
 members of other classes or structs or
 to non members.

 public
-------
 public access specifier puts no limit on the
 usage of the member (data or function).

 A public member is accessible within:
 1) Current class or struct
 2) Derived class or struct
 3) Other classes or structs 
 4) Non members.
