In C++, object can be created in 2 ways :
1) Declaration Method
2) Allocation Method

Declaration Method 
------------------
Object is declared to be an instance of a class.
It follows a syntax similar to variable declaration.
i.e.
 DataType entityName;
Example :
 Person p;
 Myclass m;

Such objects are either global or local.
There life and scope is controlled by 
the system.
As their life gets over they get auto destructed.

Allocation Method
------------------
Allocation method allows dynamic object creation 
(creation of object at program runtime) 
using "operator new". 
 
Such objects get allocated in "heap segment" of RAM. 
 
They are accessible through a pointer only. 
 
They have customized life 
 * Either until program is running
 * Until explicit deletion  
 
A dynamically created object must  be deallocated  
using the "operator delete".
