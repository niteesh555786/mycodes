C++ is an Object Oriented Programming
language.
It is an extension to the C Programming language.


Object Oriented Programming
----------------------------
OOP is an approach to application
developement where following concepts 
are applied.
1) Encapsulation
2) Polymorphism
3) Inheritance
4) Abstraction

Encapsulation
-------------
Encapsulation is binding related 
code and data into one unit.

Considering an entity, one must 
analyze its operations and characteristics.

Next a unit (class) must be defined
to enclose the operations (functions)
and characteristics (data) of the
entity.

Example Considering : Mouse

class Mouse
{
 positioner optical;
 button arr[3];
 wheel w; 

 click(){} 
 doubleClick(){}
 scroll(){}
 point(){}
 dragAndDrop(){}
}

Polymorphism
-------------
Polymorphism is implementing an
operation in multiple ways i.e. many
ways to perform a task.

Example :
 payment(Cash) {.....}
 payment(DebitCard) {.....}
 payment(LoyaltyPoints) {.....}

Inheritance
------------
Inheritance is defining new entities
from existing entities.
Its purpose is extending the operations
and characteristics.

Example :
 JuiceBar
 {
   Fruits arr[];
   Spice s;
   
   Cut() {...}
   Clean() {...}
   ExtractJuice(Grind) {....}
   ExtractJuice(Squeeze) {.....}
   Filter(){ .... }
   AddSpice() {....}

 }

 MoctailBar inherits JuiceBar
 {
   Flavour arr[];
   Mixing() {....}
   AddFlavours() {...}
 }

Abstraction
------------
Abstraction is the art of exposing
what an entity does and hiding how
it was done.

Flower f;
f.spreadFragrance();

It is hidden the flower generates
fragrance.
