Reference
---------------
A reference is an alternate identifier
for a variable or an object.

System handles references through 
additional symbol table entries that
refer to the location of an existing
variable or an object.

A reference once set to refer to a
variable or an object, cannot be made
to refer to a different variable or
object for its lifetime.

C++ supports 3 types of references.
1) Parameter Reference
2) Stand Alone Reference
3) Function Return Reference

Parameter Reference
----------------------
A formal parameter of the function
is declared as reference.
Known that the formal parameter is
initialized by the actual parameter.
Hence the formal parameter reference
gets set to refer to the memory of
the actual parameter.

Stand Alone Reference
----------------------
A local reference is declared and is
made to refer to some variable or
object.

It must be initialized while declaration.
Its limited usage is seen.

Function Return Reference
-------------------------
Would be discussed in another example.
