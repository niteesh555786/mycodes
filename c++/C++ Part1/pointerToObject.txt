Pointer to Object
------------------
C++ allows declaration of pointer of class type.
Such a pointer can :
 * refer to object of the class
 * be dereferenced to access the members of the class.

When the pointer is dereferences to access
members of the class, the caller object for
the access is the one address of which is
stored in the pointer.
