A stream is a hardware independent
entity used for transfer of information
between devices.

A stream may be unidirectional or
bidirectional and accordingly it will
allow transfer of information.

A stream must be :
 * Opened
 * Read / Written
 * Closed

3 streams are auto managed by the
system.
stdin : A channel of communication between the keyboard and the application.
stdout : A channel of communication between the application and the monitor.
stderr : A channel of communication between the application and the monitor.

To utilize these stream, C++ system
provides perdefined objects : 
 "cin" for stdin
 "cout" for stdout
 "cerr" for stderr
 
cin uses the extraction operator (>>)
to take data from the keyboard and
transfer it to the application through
stdin.

cout uses the insertion operator (<<)
to take data from the application and
transfer it to the monitor through
stdout.

cerr uses the insertion operator (<<)
to take data from the application and
transfer it to the monitor through
stdout.
