There are algorithms that act on a hierarchy
of classes.

Examples :
 Zoo
  feed(Animal * p) { .... }
 Painter
  quote(Shape * p) { .... }
 ...

Such methods host partial code that is
common and require invokation of some 
code that is specific to the classes in hierarchy.

For being able to refer to objects of all
classes in the hierarchy, such methods use
a base class pointer.

For being able to invoke class specific code
they want the classes to override the invoked
function and provide specific code there.

In case the overridden function can be
defined in the base class then it is made.

But in case the overridden function cannot
be defined in the base class then it is
made as a pure virtual function.

A pure virtual function indicates a projected
valid operation of the base class that can only 
be defined by the derived classes as per
their characteristics.
