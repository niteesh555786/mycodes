Binary Search
compares one value against values 
stored in a sorted set.

It begins by calculating mid point 
of 2 ends of the set.

The value stored at the mid point
is compared with the value to be
searched.

Three types of comparisons are performed
1) ==
2) <
3) >

If == returns true
i.e. two values are found to be 
equal then search stops and returns 
the mid position.

If < returns true
i.e. value to be searched is < 
value at mid position then the 
higher boundary is reset as 
mid -1.

If > returns true
i.e. value to be searched is > 
value at mid position then the 
lower boundary is reset as mid +1.

It stops 
when lower boundary > higher boundary.
and must return -1, a flag value that 
indicates not found.

It is applied on linear data structures 
like arrays and linked lists.
