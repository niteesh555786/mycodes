Recursion
---------
Recursion is the mechanism that allows
a function to call itself.
Recursive invocations must be logically 
controlled otherwise program gets 
terminated due to improper memory 
management (stack overflow).

Problems that have mathematically
recursive solution can be resolved
using recursion.
Example:

7 raisedTo 5 = 7 * 7 raiseTo 4
7 raisedTo 4 = 7 * 7 raiseTo 3
7 raisedTo 3 = 7 * 7 raiseTo 2
7 raisedTo 2 = 7 * 7 raiseTo 1
7 raisedTo 1 = 7 * 7 raiseTo 0
7 raisedTo 0 = 1
