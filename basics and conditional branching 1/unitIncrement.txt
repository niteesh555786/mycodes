Study of unit increment operator : ++
-----------------------------------
++ is a unit increment operator.
It increments the value of its operand by 1.
i.e.
say variable x is 10
if ++ acts on x then 
x will become 11.

++ is a unary operator.
i.e. It acts on a single operand.
x++y is illegal.
x++ is legal (postfix usage). 
++y is also legal (prefix usage).

As shown above ++ can be applied
as postfix operator or as postfix operator.

In both the usages the operator 
increments the value of its operand 
by one.

i.e.
x = 10;
x++;
x becomes 11

or
y = 10;
++y;
y becomes 11

But the two usages differ in their priority.
prefix ++ is evaluated as a high priority.
postfix ++ is evaluated as a least priority.

Refer Example : unitIncrement.c

Tip:
++ cannot be applied to constants.
++ can be applied to variables only.
Because it expands as :
var = var + 1
And the rule that a variable must
be applied on the LHS of =.
