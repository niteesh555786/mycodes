Combining Conditions
------------------
C supports combination of
multiple conditions and their
evaluation as a single boolean
result using :
Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||) 

System evaluates all the conditions
(or may have a short circuit)
and generates individual boolean
results.
Next system combines the 
boolean results using Logical 
AND (&&) or Logical OR (||)
as used.

Results are based on following
truth tables.

Truth Table : Logical And (&&)
  T && T = T
  T && F = F
  F && T = F
  F && F = F

Truth Table : Logical Or (&&)
  T || T = T
  T || F = T
  F || T = T
  F || F = F

Tip:
Priority of && is higher than
that of ||.
Their associativity is Left to Right.
