Abstract
----------
Java allows declaration of methods 
and classes as "abstract".

Abstract methods
-----------------
An abstract method is a method:
 * With declaration (signature) only and not definition (body).
 * That must be overridden by the sub classes.
 * That makes the class abstract.

Abstract class
---------------
An abstract class is a class:
 * That cannot be instantiated.
 * That must be inherited for use.
 * That has ZERO to MANY abstract methods.

Inheritance of Abstract Class
----------------------------
Known that by inheritance a sub
class gets :
 CODE 
 DATA
 COMPATIBILITY
from the super class.

As an abstract class is inherited the 
sub class along with normal methods 
also inherits the abstract methods.

Due to presence of abstract methods 
the sub class also turns abstract.

If the sub class overrides all the
abstract methods then it can become
a normal class again.

Q) Known that an abstract class 
    cannot be instantiated, can it
    have data members and constructors?
A) YES.
    Its data members would be the
    data members of the sub class.
    Its constructors would be invoked 
    as object of the sub class is created.

    In short, all that an abstract class 
    defines is for its sub classes.
