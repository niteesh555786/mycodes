Access Specifiers
-----------------
Access specifiers control the usability of members 
of a class/interface.

For an interface, Java supports only one type of 
access specifier and it is public.

For a class, Java supports 4 types of access specifiers :
1) private
2) no access specifier
3) protected
4) public

private
---------
private access specifier limits the usage of the 
member within the current class only.

A private member is not accessible in
* Other classes of same package
* Other classes of other package

No Access Specifier Set
-------------------------
When no access specifier is applied then the member 
can be used within
 * current class
 * sub classess of same package
 * non sub classes of same package

Such members cannot be used in
 * sub classes that belong to a different package
 * non sub classes that belong to a different package 

protected
------------
When protected access specifier is applied then 
the member can be used within
 * current class
 * sub classess of same package
 * non sub classes of same package
 * sub classes that belong to a different package

Such members cannot be used in
 * non sub classes that belong to a different package 

public
---------
When public access specifier is applied then the 
member can be used every where without any 
restriction.

i.e. The member can be within
 * current class
 * sub classess of same package
 * non sub classes of same package
 * sub classes that belong to a different package
 * non sub classes that belong to a different package
