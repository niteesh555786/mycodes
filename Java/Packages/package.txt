Package
--------
A package is a collection of classes, interfaces 
and nested packages.

It defines an application (Project) or a libarary (API).

To make a package :
* Make a directory of the same name as of the package.

To add classes, interfaces, ... in a package :
* Define them with package statement as their first statement.
* Save them in the package directory.
(If the class, ... is public then it must be saved in a file that takes the same name as of the class, ...)

To use a package :
* Its parent directory location must be set in CLASSPATH.
* It must be imported.
* Its public classes, enumerations and interfaces can be used.

FYI
-----
If a java class is not put in any package 
then the system considers it to be in a 
no-name package that spans the current 
directory.
