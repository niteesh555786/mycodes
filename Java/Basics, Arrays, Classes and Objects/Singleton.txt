Singleton Class
---------------
A singleton class is a class that can be
instantiated only once.
Ideally a class that controls a resource
is made singleton.

Steps to make a class Singleton are :
----------------------------------
1) Hide all of its constructors so that the 
normal approach of object creation is blocked.

2) Define a static method that would create 
one object of the class and return the same 
everytime.
