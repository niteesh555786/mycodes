Java allows formation secondary datatype
through classes.
Being a datatype it (class) is used by 
instantiation.

Object (instance) creation  is a three step
process :
1) Memory Allocation
2) Execution of non static initializer block
3) Execution of constructor


Memory Allocation
-------------------
An object gets allocated in the heap seg.
of RAM.
It is a composite block formed by a collection
of the non static data members declared by 
the class.

Non static Initializer Block
--------------------------
A non static initializer block is a block 
of code (without any signature) that 
belongs to the class.
It gets auto executed for every object
created.
It is used to initialize the data members
of the object.
A class may have multiple non static
initializer blocks.
In such a case all the blocks get executed
per object created. 
The order of execution is the top to bottom
order of definition in the class. 

Constructor
-------------
A constructor is a special method of the
class.
It has the same name as of the class and
no return type specification.
It gets auto executed for every object
created.
It is used to initialize the data members
of the object.

Java allows definition of multiple constructors
for a class, each with a unqiue set of parameters.
This is termed as Constructor Overloading.

Overloading constructors is implementing
polymorphism. 

Recall that polymorphism allows definition
of multiple ways to perform a task.
And the multiple constructor allows multiple
ways of initialization of the object.
