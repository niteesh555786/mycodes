What is Java?
Java is an Object Oriented and
a Platform Independent programming
language.

Object Oriented Programming
----------------------------
Object Oriented Programming is
a programming paradigm in which'
for application development following
concepts are implemented.

Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Abstraction

Encapsulation
--------------
Encapsulation is an OOP concept
in which for an entity the operations
(code) and the attributes (data)
are enclosed in one unit.

Polymorphism
------------
Polymorphism is an OOP concept
in which for an operation multiple
methods may be defined.

Inheritance
------------
Inheritance is an OOP concept
in which a new entity is derived
from an existing entity.
The derived entity :
 1) Gets code and data from existing entity.
 2) Hosts extended code and data.
 3) Is compatible with existing entity.

Abstraction
------------
Abstraction is an OOP concept
in which an entity exposes its
operations but hides their implementations
from the user.

An alarm uses Time.
It knows that Time updates
but it is unaware of the logic
how the Clock would calculate
the pulse of a second. 


Platform Independent
---------------------
A platform is an environment
(hardware + software) that 
allows execution of applications.

Platform Dependence
--------------------
Application are developed using
the Application API, which inturn
relies on OS API.
Hence on compilation the binary 
executable file that gets generated 
becomes OS compatible and specific.

This is platform dependence. 

Platform Independence
--------------------
Java applications are developed 
using the Java Application API, 
which inturn relies on JVM.

Hence on compilation the binary 
executable file that gets generated 
becomes JVM compatible and specific.

This is JVM dependence. 

Oracle Corporation has developed
JVM for all operating systems.

A compiled Java binary executable
file that is JVM compatible can
be ported to any JVM.

JVM would be responsible for
making that file compatible to
the underlying OS and getting
it executed.

This is platform independence.
