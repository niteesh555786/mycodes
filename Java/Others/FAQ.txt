Q) Java has new operator for memory
allocation, what about memory deallocation?
A) Java allocates objects and array in
heap segment of RAM.
They are identified and used through references.
When reference to an object or an array
gets dropped, the referred array or the
object becomes unreferenced.
Java runtime environment uses a parallel
running high priority thread named as 
"finalizer" that 
1) scans the heap segment for detecting 
unreferenced objects.
2) auto deallocates them.
The process is termed as "Garbage Collection".

So for memory deallocation Java uses the
garbage collection mechanism.

Q) Can methods have the same name as of the class?
A) Yes. System doesnt conflict then with a constructor
because a method has return type specification in its
signature whereas constructor doesnt has one.
