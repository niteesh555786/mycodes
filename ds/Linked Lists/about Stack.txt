A stack is a linear data structure.
Being linear it stores data in a
sequential pattern.
It has one open end termed as "top".
All data enters/exits the Stack from
the top.
The data that enters it is stored in
an overlapped manner.
While extraction data is removed
from the stack in top to bottom
order.
Hence develops a Last In and 
First Out data movement order.


Operations on Stack:

* init : To clear the garbaage of the Stack and to set it to a initial state.
* push : To add one value at the top of the Stack. Operation may raise overflow error.
* pop : To remove one value from the top of the Stack. Operation may raise underflow error.
* peek : To fetch the topmost value of the Stack. Value is not removed, its only viewed.
* isEmpty : A check for empty state of the Stack.
* isFull : A check for full state of the Stack.

(For practice students often define a display operation.)
